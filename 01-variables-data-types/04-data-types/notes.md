# Data Types

## Primitive Data Types

+**String**: Sequence of character. must be in quotes or backticks.
+**Number**: Integers as well as afloating-point numbers.
+**Boolean**: Logical entity / true and false.
+**Null**: Intentional absence of any object value.
+**Undefined**: aAvariable that has not yet been defined / assigned.
+**Symbol**: Built-in object whose constructor returns a unique symbol.
+**BigInt**: Numbers that are greater than the "Number" type can handle.

## References Types (Objects)

Reference types or "objects" are a non-primitive value and when assigned to a variable, the variable is given a reference to that value.

Object literals, arrays and functions are all reference types.

## Static Typing vs Dynamic Types

**JavaScript is a dynamically-types language**. This means, we do not explicitly define the types for our variables. Many other languages are **statically-typed** such as C, C++ and Java.

**TypeScript** is a superset of JavaScript, which allows static-typing. This can make your code more verbose and less prone to errors. TypeScript may be something you want to look into later on.
